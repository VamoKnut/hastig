I want to prototype a full-stack applciation called "HASTIG"
The purpose is to perform water discharge measurements using salt dilution method. The system will use remote, lowpower IoT nodes ("sensor nodes") in rivers to measure conductivity.

THe backend will communicate with the sensor nodes using MQTT. THe web ui will consist of two parts. One mamangement part or "dashbord" used by 
hydrologist to define "projects", assign equipment and personel to proejcts and give location data to such objects. The second part will be used by persons in the field ("Care takers"), to orchestrate 
the injection of salt at specific sites.

Well use the term "project" for the setting up of a site, consisting of one or more sensors (hardware at a specific location), care takers (one or more persons actually injecting salt in the river) and drop-sites 
(basically coordinates with a name and decription that will be used for individual gaugings. We will indicate for care takers hwo much salt they are expected to inject for each gauging in advance.

All activity, planning, settings and results for a gauging is contained in a "campaign". A campaign has a life cycle
